vimrc
=====

## Installing and updating packages
This config uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), 
so you'll need to run `:PlugInstall` and possibly `:PlugUpdate` whenever consider an
update of the plug-ins is necessary.

This vimrc config will automatically install plug-ins for the first time cloned from github.

i.e.
1. Under your home directory, run:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:vsdmars/vimrc.git ~/.vim
```
3. Launch vim which will automatically install plug-ins on its behalf.

From there, you should occasionally run `:PlugUpdate` to keep your plugins up-to-date.

You can also run `:PlugUpgrade` to upgrade vim-plug itself. 


## To disable plugins
Rename package folder under ./layer with prefix '_' (e.g. theme -> \_theme) to
disable plugins within that folder from being installed/set.
